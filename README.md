Bisection-Method

The Bisection Method at the same time gives a proof of the Intermediate Value
Theorem and provides a practical method to find roots of equations. If your 
calculator can solve equations numerically, it most likely uses a combination
of the Bisection Method and the Newton-Raphson Method.
